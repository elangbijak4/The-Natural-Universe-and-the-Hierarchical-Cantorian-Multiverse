# The-Natural-Universe-and-the-Hierarchical-Cantorian-Multiverse
This paper introduces an axiomatic framework called the Natural Universe, in which physical reality is described as a discrete, computable, and linguistically representable system.
Starting from Planck’s postulate of quantized energy, the model formalizes four theorems: the discreteness of energy and mass, the computability of universal mechanisms, and the linguistic representability of physical law.
Relaxing these axioms implies the existence of universes that are continuous, non-computable, or transfinite, giving rise to a Hierarchical Cantorian Multiverse ordered by computational cardinality.
Each level of this multiverse corresponds to a distinct mode of existence—from countable, Turing-decidable universes to hypercomputational and transfinite domains.
The paper further argues that the definition of energy itself determines the ontology of computation: a new empirical definition of energy would produce a new class of physical machines, potentially beyond Turing limits.
This framework suggests a paradigm shift from physics to computation as the primary language of being, in which the universe is not merely governed by laws but operates as a self-executing process—an ontological computation through which reality brings itself into existence.
